# Polygon Middleman

A full-featured desktop web application for uploading and managing competitive programming problems on **Codeforces Polygon** via the Polygon API.

## Features

- **Problem Management**: Create, edit, and manage problems from a single dashboard
- **One-Click ZIP Import**: Import one or many fully-structured problem ZIPs in a single batch — auto-creates the problem, uploads the statement, checker, solution, and grouped tests, and configures subtask policies
- **Batch Test Upload**: Upload tests from ZIP files with auto-parsing of groups and indices
- **Multi-Language Statements**: Split a single LaTeX block into English, Russian, Tajik, and Uzbek
- **Solution Management**: Upload, view, delete with 12 tag types
- **Test Groups & Subtasks**: Inline editing, derive dependencies and points from statement
- **Checker/Validator**: Standard checkers or custom C++ files
- **Statement Preview**: View compiled HTML preview with MathJax
- **8-Step Upload Wizard**: Guided flow from problem creation to commit
- **Complete API Coverage**: All 30+ Polygon API methods implemented
- **Dark Theme**: Sunset Ember color scheme with animations

## Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **HTTP**: httpx (async), requests (multipart)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ with pip
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Polygon API key and secret

Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** — the app itself is fully cross-platform; only the convenience launchers differ per OS.

### Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Credentials** live in `backend/config.json`, which is **gitignored and never committed** — your API key/secret never reach GitHub. A `config.example.json` shows the shape; the real file is created locally when you save credentials in **Settings**. On a new device/clone you re-enter them once.

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running

```bash
# Windows
start.bat

# macOS / Linux (first run: chmod +x start.sh)
./start.sh
```

Each launcher creates the venv, installs deps, starts both servers, and opens the browser. Or run the two servers manually:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

> On macOS/Linux you can also use `./start_backend.sh` and `./start_frontend.sh` to run each server separately (the `.bat` equivalents are for Windows).

### First Use

1. Go to **Settings** and enter your Polygon API credentials
2. Return to **Problems** — list loads automatically
3. Use **Import ZIP** for one-click batch import, **Upload Wizard** for a guided flow, or click a problem to manage it

## Develop in the Cloud (GitHub Codespaces)

This repo ships a [`.devcontainer`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) so you can work from any device with zero local setup. On GitHub, click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**. The container installs Python deps (into `backend/venv`) and `npm install`s the frontend automatically.

Inside the Codespace (Linux — `start.bat` is Windows-only, so run the servers directly):

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
backend/venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000 --app-dir backend

# Terminal 2 — frontend
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

Port **5173** opens a preview automatically; **8000** is forwarded for the API. Because `backend/config.json` is gitignored, re-enter your Polygon credentials in **Settings** the first time (each Codespace is a fresh environment).

## Key Features

### ZIP Import (Batch)

Click **Import ZIP** on the Problems page and select one or more `.zip` files. Each ZIP holds a single problem:

```
edu-problem-name/           # the folder name becomes the Polygon slug
├── problem_statement.mdx   # 4-language statement (\textbf{English} … markers)
├── checker.cpp
├── solution.cpp            # main correct → tagged MA
├── validator.cpp           # optional → set as validator
├── wa_*.cpp / tle_*.cpp    # optional extra solutions, tagged by prefix
└── testset/                # also accepts the "tesset/" spelling
    ├── input_s0_idx0.txt    # group 0 = samples (useInStatements)
    ├── input_s1_idx0.txt    # group N from the _sN_ in the filename
    └── ...
```

**Strict reading** — the importer only reads these components: `problem_statement.mdx` (or `.tex`), `checker.cpp`, `solution.cpp`, an optional `validator.cpp`, optional extra solutions (`.cpp` whose name starts with a tag prefix — `wa`, `tle`/`tl`/`slow`, `mle`/`ml`, `re`/`rte`, `pe`, `to`, `tm`, `ok`/`ac`/`brute`), and `input*.txt` files inside `testset/`. Everything else (editorials, generators, `.DS_Store`, answer files, etc.) is ignored.

**Pre-flight validation** — the preview screen flags problems before upload: missing checker/solution/tests/languages, **non-contiguous test groups** (e.g. 0,1,3 — missing 2), and scoring tables that reference groups without tests. You can also **edit the slug, time limit and memory limit per ZIP** right in the preview. A local **import history** (with Polygon links and copyable slugs) persists across sessions.

**Handling a slug that already exists** — each ZIP has an **If exists** policy:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Skip** | Leave the existing problem untouched. |
| **Fill / update** *(default)* | Upload the archive into the existing problem — adds what's missing and overwrites what changed. This is also what **Retry** uses. |
| **Reset & overwrite** | Discard the problem's working copy first, then upload. |

> ⚠️ The Polygon API has **no delete-problem method** (deletion is UI-only), so *Reset* discards the **working copy** and re-uploads. It fully resets a problem that was never committed, but it can't remove already-committed surplus tests — for that, delete the problem in the Polygon UI first, then import.

For every problem the importer runs an isolated pipeline:

1. Creates the problem using the **full folder name as the slug** (the `edu-` prefix is kept), or a per-ZIP override
2. Sets limits — 1000 ms / 256 MB by default, or per-ZIP overrides — with `stdin`/`stdout`
3. Saves a statement per detected language
4. Uploads `checker.cpp` (and `validator.cpp` if present) and sets them
5. Uploads `solution.cpp` tagged `MA`, plus any extra solutions with their prefix-detected tags (`WA`, `TL`, …)
6. Enables groups and points, then uploads grouped tests (each test retried; duplicate-content tests still written so the `1..N` enumeration never gaps)
7. Sets every group's points policy to `COMPLETE_GROUP`, then:
   - **If the statement has a scoring section** — auto-runs **Derive Dependencies** and **Derive Points**, parsing the scoring table for per-group dependencies and points.
   - **Otherwise** — makes the **last group depend on all other groups** and assigns **100 points** to the last group.
8. **Commits** the changes and requests **verification** via `buildPackage(verify=true)`, which invokes every solution on every test (and the checker on stress tests) to confirm the tags are valid

> The commit is required because the Polygon API can only verify a *committed* revision — the web UI's working-copy "Verify" button is not exposed as an API method.

Imports are **fault-isolated**: a failing step is logged in red and the pipeline continues; a failing problem is skipped and the rest of the batch keeps going. If any test fails to upload after retries, commit + verify are skipped so the problem stays clean for a re-import. A per-problem summary is shown at the end.

### Multi-Language Splitting

Paste a single LaTeX block with language markers (`\textbf{English}`, `\textbf{Russian}`, etc.) and click **Split Languages** to automatically parse and save to all languages.

### 8-Step Upload Wizard

1. Select/Create Problem
2. Problem Info
3. Statement
4. Checker
5. Validator
6. Solutions
7. Tests
8. Review & Commit

### Test Groups & Subtasks

- Auto-enable groups and points
- Derive dependencies from Scoring section
- Derive points from Scoring section
- Inline edit group and points
- Auto-mark group 0 as samples
